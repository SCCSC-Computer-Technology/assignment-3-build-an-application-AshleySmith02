Code Review
The code was good and well documented. I like how you had a home page that explained how the application works. I also really like the colors added to the app so its not a boring black and white. However there a some issues. I recieved a build error when I ran the code and I don't see any data populated onto the application when I do open it. So I don't get the full
view of all the functionality of the Application. So I can't say much to the functionality of the Application but it looks great and I think has a lot of potential.
